        output: `Photosynthesis is the amazing process that plants use to create their own food. By absorbing sunlight through their leaves, plants convert light energy into chemical energy. They take in carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil to produce glucose, which feeds the plant. As a byproduct of this reaction, plants release oxygen back into the atmosphere, which is essential for all living creatures. This cycle is a fundamental part of life on Earth.`
